<h1> AirBnB clone - The console</h1></p>

<h3> Description</h3>
<b>First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.</b>
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:
<ul>
        <li>put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances</li>
        <li>create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file</li>
        <li>create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel</li>
        <li>create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.</li>
        <li>create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine</li>
</ul>
</p>
